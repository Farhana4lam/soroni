            “Soroni” is a platform providing all the data of those NGOs who are working to develop child education. 
            Firstly, there are many NGO but still many children can’t join them. 
            Because, separate platform has separate time periods. 
            “Soroni” is here to make them all together. 
            A willing student just have to enter their location, and available time; and “Soroni” will show them the nearest NGO.
            Secondly, some students drop out because of less study materials.

              One of the main purposes of this website is to encourage and facilitate learning so that all the children can get educated.
              Many students give up their study because they have to work for their livings in the school time, and they don’t get opportunity to know the timings of NGO schools as well. 
              They are the future of Bangladesh. 
              And for the lack of opportunity and proper guidelines they remain illiterate. 
              Soroni is the place to give them a chance to learn on their free time from any nearest NGO schools.
